## Config

Use `deploy/pi-deploy.yaml` as the shared deploy contract and `deploy/pi-deploy.local.yaml` for machine-specific overrides such as host, SSH user, project dir, and branch. `yoyoctl remote` merges them directly, and `yoyoctl remote config edit` is the preferred way to create or update the local override.

If the file does not exist yet, run `yoyoctl remote config edit` first. That command creates `deploy/pi-deploy.local.yaml` automatically before opening it.

## Argument Parsing

Parse the arguments string provided after `/yoyopod-screenshot`:

- **--readback flag:** If `--readback` is present, request LVGL readback. Otherwise use the shadow buffer.

## Steps

1. **Capture the screenshot to a temporary local PNG.** Run:
   ```bash
   yoyoctl remote screenshot [--readback] --output <local_temp_path>
   ```
   Use a temporary local path such as `./pi_screenshot.png`.

2. **Display the PNG.** Use the agent's local image viewing tool to show the saved screenshot in the conversation.

3. **Explain what was captured.** After showing the image:
   - Default mode: "This is the shadow buffer - what the app sent to the display."
   - `--readback`: "This is the requested LVGL readback path - what LVGL actually rendered if the native snapshot succeeded."

   Remind the user they can ask follow-up questions about what they see, such as "why is the status bar missing?" or "what screen is this?"

4. **If the user is debugging screenshot fidelity, verify the capture path in logs.** Run:
   ```bash
   yoyoctl remote logs --lines 20
   ```
   Confirm one of these outcomes:
   - `Saved screenshot via LVGL readback` means the readback path succeeded.
   - `Saved screenshot via shadow buffer` means the capture used the shadow path instead.

5. **Clean up.** Delete the temporary local screenshot file after displaying it.
