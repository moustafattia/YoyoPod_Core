# YoyoPod VoIP + Local Music Integration Record

**Last updated:** 2026-04-07
**Status:** Implemented

This document started as a plan and now serves as the completion record for the VoIP + local music integration that ships on `main`.

## What Is Implemented

- unified `YoyoPodApp` coordinator in `yoyopy/app.py`
- split orchestration models in `yoyopy/fsm.py`
- derived app runtime state in `yoyopy/coordinators/runtime.py`
- music auto-pause on incoming call
- optional music auto-resume after call end
- screen stack transitions for incoming, outgoing, and active calls
- periodic now-playing refresh for progress updates
- simulation mode using the web server and keyboard input

## Current Implementation Map

### Coordinator

- `yoyopy/app.py`

Responsibilities:

- load config
- initialize display/input/screen infrastructure
- start VoIP and music backends
- register callbacks
- coordinate call interruption and resume behavior

### Music Layer

- `yoyopy/audio/music/backend.py`
- `yoyopy/audio/local_service.py`

Responsibilities:

- app-managed mpv lifecycle and JSON IPC
- playback control and property-event handling
- local playlist discovery, shuffle input, and recent-track integration

### VoIP Layer

- `yoyopy/voip/manager.py`

Responsibilities:

- Liblinphone lifecycle and iterate loop
- registration state tracking
- typed call/message event translation
- caller lookup and callback dispatch

### UI Layer

- `yoyopy/ui/display/`
- `yoyopy/ui/input/`
- `yoyopy/ui/screens/`

The older `display.py`, `screens.py`, `screen_manager.py`, and `input_handler.py` layout is no longer current.

## Integrated States

Key states used by the running app:

- `PLAYING`
- `PAUSED`
- `CALL_IDLE`
- `CALL_INCOMING`
- `CALL_OUTGOING`
- `CALL_ACTIVE`
- `PLAYING_WITH_VOIP`
- `PAUSED_BY_CALL`
- `CALL_ACTIVE_MUSIC_PAUSED`

See `yoyopy/fsm.py` for the music/call transitions and `yoyopy/coordinators/runtime.py` for the derived application state mapping.

## Incoming Call Flow

1. `VoIPManager` receives an incoming call event from the Liblinphone backend
2. `YoyoPodApp` pauses music if playback is active
3. state changes to `CALL_INCOMING`
4. `IncomingCallScreen` is pushed
5. answer/reject actions route back through `VoIPManager`
6. call end clears call screens and optionally resumes music

## Outgoing Call Flow

1. user navigates to contacts
2. `VoIPManager.make_call()` issues the SIP call through Liblinphone
3. outgoing and in-call screens are pushed as typed call state changes arrive
4. call end pops call screens and returns the app to the prior playback state

## Music Playback Flow

1. screen action triggers a music-backend command
2. `MpvBackend` receives push events from mpv over JSON IPC
3. `LocalMusicService` handles local playlist and filesystem browse concerns
4. callbacks refresh `NowPlayingScreen`
5. derived runtime state stays synchronized with actual playback state

## What Changed After The Original Plan

The original integration work predated later backend and UI refactors. The current code now uses:

- `InputManager` instead of `InputHandler`
- `Display` HAL instead of a single hardcoded display module
- split screen modules instead of one `screens.py`
- `MpvBackend` instead of the removed JSON-RPC music client

## Remaining Cleanup Outside Integration

The integration itself is done. Remaining repository work is separate:

- continue reducing stale historical docs
- migrate older demos and tests to current names and entry points
- finish semantic input migration inside screen implementations
- reduce hardcoded hardware assumptions
